Data Import For Movie Recommender
=================================

Scripts to import data to be used for the basis of a movie recommender demo using Seldon. The data used is:

 1. [Movielens 10 Million dataset](http://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/)
 1. [Hetrec 2011 dataset](http://grouplens.org/datasets/hetrec-2011/)
 1. Some data sourced from Freebase by Seldon by matching movie names and year release to freebase entries.

## Docker Steps

Build the Docker container:

```
   make build_image
```

Run import (you will need 430M of free space for the raw_data and transformed/combined data)

```
   make import
```

For completeness the script to recreate the Freebase data is provided in ```/scripts/getFreebaseData.py``` and is run as

```
  python getFreebaseData.py -movies <location of ml10m>/movies.dat
```

## Create a Movie Recommender Demo

Using this transformed and combined data you can create a movie recommender demo by following the steps in the [Seldon docs](http://docs.seldon.io/movie-recommender-demo.html)
